Description: Java Swing Diagramming Library
 JGraph X is based on the mxGraph architecture, a re-designed core based
 on JGraph experience.
 .
 The new library API is designed to provide a much lower learning curve as
 well as making the feature set easier to extend and integrate. Sharing the
 model code base of mxGraph, the web diagramming library, enabling applications
 written in Java to be more easily ported to mxGraph-based web applications.
 .
 Overall, JGraph X provides more features that JGraph, with a far smaller code
 size and complexity. Redesigning the codebase from scratch now means
 implementing common feature extensions are easier and require less coding.
 A number of new loosely coupled application-centric features have been added,
 making prototyping even faster, without their usage restricting application
 flexibility.
